Playing with a robot
====================


Verse
-----
    They were so good togheter
    And they practiced every day
    They were a great team

    Their speed was unmatched
    And their movements precise
    No one can beat youâ€¦
    when you're in love

    But now, look at the table
    How can that be?
    It has dust and empty bottles all over it

    He cries in the corner
    Alone through the night
    he needs a new partner

Chorus
------
    What a wonderful robot
    That throws balls on his way
    He got back to his old game
    No more lonliness today

    Such a wonderful robot
    Throwing balls at his side
    With the help of the ping-pong
    No more lonliness tonight
