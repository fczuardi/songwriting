Tsundoku
========

VERSE
-----
    Her name is Sophie
    she never misses a yard sale
    Her friends are dopey
    they hangout at Bloomingdale's


    Her library is nice
    it's close to perfection
    You wouldn't believe in the price
    of such a collection


CHORUS
------

    She has more books than she can read,
    and keeps getting more
    She gets excited at first,
    but then she get bored

    (oh, Tsundoku!)

    She has more books than she can read,
    and it haunts her
    It's been always the same old script.
    oh, Tsundoku!

    (oh, Tsundoku!)
